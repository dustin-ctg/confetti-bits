This is going to be our go-to resource for all the project notes and quick references we'll need for learning Adobe. 
Here you can find a (## Useful Links)[categorized list of useful links], intended outcomes, and an ongoing record of how our goals change
as we progress. There will also a separate post dedicated specifically to useful resources and, depending on the session,
there may be additional posts with instructions or reminders about how to achieve certain designs or effects.
