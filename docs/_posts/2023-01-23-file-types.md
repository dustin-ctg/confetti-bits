We're going to cover a few different file types, and when to use what to make sure your designs look their best in every environment. A lot of the web apps available online don't typically inform their users what file types they need for certain design jobs, and it can and often does lead to some pretty crusty results in the final designs. 

Our main topics will include:
- Vector vs Raster
- Print vs Web
- Adobe Files
- Handling Uncommon File Types
- Converting File Types

More info coming soon!
